  {
    question: "What is ScanOnline?",
    answer: `ScanOnline is a free online tool, which you can use to scan your 
        documents online.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Does it work offline?",
    answer: `Yes, it is a fully offline working app. However, you need an internet connection when you load it the 
        first time duh, and also for ocassional updates. For best offline experience, add to homescreen. Go give it a try, turn off your internet and reload this page.`,
  },
  {
    question:
      "I clicked photos, but accidentally closed the app without making my PDF. How can I recover those pictures?",
    answer: `You don't need to do anything because we've got you covered. Until you download your PDF, 
        your images are automatically saved and loaded the next time you re-open the app.`,
  },
  {
    question: "I am concerned about privacy. What if my pictures get leaked?",
    answer: `We assure you there'll never be such a thing like that. Because our app is serverless, meaning that
        no data is ever sent to the server, except for some usage statistics for analytics.`,
  },
  {
    question: `I don't want to keep filling my information everytime I make a PDF.`,
    answer: `You don't have to. Your details are automatically loaded from the last time you filled them.`,
  },
  {
    question: "I use the app frequently. Can I add it to my homescreen?",
    answer: `Yes you can. When you visit the app for the first time, you'll get a prompt to 'Add to home screen'
        or something like that. Click on that and it'll be ready to launch on your home screen just like your other
        favorite apps.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Will this service be free forever?",
    answer: `Yes this is a labor of love, and you'll never have to pay a dime, ever.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How can I contribute?",
    answer: `You can contact me at nikeshlepcha7@gmail.com. Buy me a coffee. Also if you are a developer,
        this project is open source and is on github at https://github.com/Nike-rgb/ScanOnline---Scan-your-documents-online. Go give it a visit and star it.`,
